# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data analysis project showing Customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL and Power Bi.

Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to delivering insights through an interactive dashboard and a written report. The goal is to showcase practical skills in data analysis, data cleaning, SQL querying, and business intelligence visualization.

The project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL analysis using PostgreSQL

Power BI dashboard creation

Final analytical report with insights and conclusions

Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to business or operational performance.

It includes multiple variables such as numerical measures, categorical attributes, and time-based fields.

The raw dataset is first loaded and explored in Python before being cleaned and stored in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.

(Note: Dataset details can be customized or anonymized depending on confidentiality.)

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning

PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL querying

SQL – Data aggregation, filtering, and analytical queries

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

Git/GitHub – Version control and project sharing

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas.

Reviewed data structure, columns, and data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values.

Standardized formats and corrected data types.

Prepared clean dataset for database storage.

SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.

Wrote SQL queries for aggregation, filtering, and KPI analysis.

Validated insights across Python and SQL results.

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Visualized key metrics, trends, and comparisons.

Enabled filtering for dynamic analysis.

Reporting

Summarized insights, trends, and recommendations.

Documented findings in a clear, business-focused report.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trends over time

Category and segment comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

The dashboard is designed for non-technical stakeholders and supports data-driven decision-making.

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns within the data.

Highlighted performance drivers and potential improvement areas.

Translated raw data into actionable business insights.

Demonstrated the ability to connect technical analysis with real-world outcomes.
